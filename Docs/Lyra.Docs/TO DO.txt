1. (DONE!)Change API results to APIResult and its derived classes

2. (DONE!) Return AuthorizationSignature as a result of authorization instead of requesting the whole block, 
and save the updated block in local storage

3. (DONE!) Create IOpenAccount interface and add it to all receive and genesis blocks when they are the first blocks on teh account, OR
   make universal Open Account block and make it teh first block on teh account before any type of receive or genesis blocks is added

   so only the latest block stored in the client will be sufficient to process subsequent transactions

5. Add AuthorizationSignature validations at client
